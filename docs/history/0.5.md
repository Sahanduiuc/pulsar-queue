## Ver. 0.5.1 - 2016-Nov-25

Several internal changes and bug fixes

* Dropped ``pubsub`` in favour of pulsar ``channels``
* Redis backend uses namespace for both channels and queues
* Better serialisation support for messages
* Added ``register_broker`` function to api
* Added ``queue_message`` function to api


## Ver. 0.5.0 - 2016-Oct-11

Backward incompatible release with a considerable amount of internal and API refactoring

* Ability to add additional consumers to the queue server (see [pulsar-twitter](https://github.com/quantmind/pulsar-twitter) for example)
* Each consumer is an attribute of the server queue api and backend objects
* Renamed ``TaskFuture`` to ``MessageFuture``
* Handle ``max_retries`` with ``retry_delay``
* ``TaskError`` can be used in order to avoid a full stack trace dump. It means it is a TaskError handled by the Job callable.
* Added ``timeout`` to task execution
* Max concurrent tasks is a linear function of number of cores and ``concurrent_tasks`` parameter
